# 📌 AI Powered Sinhala Legal Document Summarizer and Analyzer

This project is an **AI-powered web-based system** designed to summarize and analyze **Sinhala legal documents** in order to improve legal accessibility for non-expert Sri Lankan citizens.

Legal documents such as contracts, court rulings, and regulations are often written in complex and technical Sinhala language, making them difficult for the general public to understand. Since Sinhala is a **low-resource language** in Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are very limited tools available for legal document summarization in the Sri Lankan context.
